## FAQs
1. Why is the function not inputing the txt file?
> To solve this issue you can try the following two things
> - Make sure your **.txt** files exist in the same folder where you have put the **.cpp** and **.h** files.
> - Make sure that the format of your file is correct.
> - Make sure that the name of opening **.txt** file is the same as you are entering and the file format is **.txt**.
2. Why is the program giving me a _file not found_ error ?
> Probaly the main reason to why you are getting this error is that your **.cpp** and **.h** files are in seperate folders. Make sure that they are in one folder.
