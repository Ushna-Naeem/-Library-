1. Why is the function not inputing the txt file?
> To solve this issue you can try the following two things
> - Make sure your **.txt** files exist in the same folder where you have put the **.cpp** and **.h** files.
> - Make sure that the name of opening **.txt** file is the same as you are entering and the file format is **.txt**.
> - Make sure that the format of your file is correct. For instance in case of Books.txt:  
> ```
> Book.txt (Make sure that there is no extra line in between the inputs)
> 2                                    //(Quantity of books)
> B1                                   //(1st book's serial number)  
> The Great Gatsby                     //(1st book's name)  
> F.Scott Fitzgerald                   //(1st book's author)
> Tragedy                              //(1st book's genre)  
> unavailable                          //(1st book's avalability)  
> B2                                   //(2nd book's serial number)  
> Pride and Prejudice                  //(2nd book's name) 
> Jane Autsen                          //(2nd book's author)
> Romance                              //(2nd book's genre)  
> available                            //(2nd book's avalability) 
> ```
> You can consult the .txt files in the repositry for the formats of other .txt files. 
2. Why is the program giving me a _file not found_ error ?
> Probaly the main reason to why you are getting this error is that your **.cpp** and **.h** files are in seperate folders. Make sure that they are in one folder.
