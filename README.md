## FAQs
1. Why is the function not inputing the txt file?
> To solve this issue you can try the following two things
> - Make sure your **.txt** files exist in the same folder where you have put the **.cpp** and **.h** files.
> - Make sure that the name of opening **.txt** file is the same as you are entering and the file format is **.txt**.
> - Make sure that the format of your file is correct. For instance in case of Books.txt:  
> ```
> Book.txt (Make sure that there is no extra line in between the inputs)

2. Why is the program giving me a _file not found_ error ?
> Probaly the main reason to why you are getting this error is that your **.cpp** and **.h** files are in seperate folders. Make sure that they are in one folder.  
3. The program is not working properly, I am getting alot of errors?
> This might be because you are running the file on any other IDE except Visula Studio 2012. It is advised to run the program on Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate only.
